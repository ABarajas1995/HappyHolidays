    <h1>Happy Holidays</h1>
    <h2>By Alexander Barajas</h2>
    <p>Christmas is usually a time where people come together and spend time with
    their families and other loved ones. There's food, gifts, music. For some people,
  though, it's a tougher time of the year. Growing up, Christmas was difficult and I wasn't very
fond of the holiday. This is the story of how I came to enjoy Christmas. Also, feel free to shape
the happy snowman's nose to your liking!</p>
